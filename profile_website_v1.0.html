        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #1 - Writing a novel📖✍️:</u></b></p>
        <p>My first hobbie/past time is writing a novel📖✍️. The reason why I like writing novels is because I find that I can be very expressive when writing novels.
            I find that I can also change the story towards my liking just like how other authors or film directors like
            to change the story to their own personal tastes. Not only do I get to express myself by writing but I also get to
            write based on my own personal experience and what I've learnt in life through either the protagonist, antagonist or
            supporting characters instead of telling that own personal experience to readers through myself. I also like to write
            about not just my personal experience in life but also general experiences that we have all faced in life like maybe 
            what guys have to go through in life or what girls have to go through in life and the reality that we all really face when
            living in this world. I specifically love writing about alternate history and multiverses as I find them really captivating
            the what ifs and the myseteries of the world mixed with a slice of life, romance, action and drama in my novel really helps
            me blend what I really love with the common genres of novels, movies and tv dramas (especially the Korean dramas as well!).

        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #2 - Watching shows and movies (like Netflix & YouTube)📺:</u></b></p>
        <p> My second hobbie/past time is watching shows and movies📺. I like to watch shows on YouTube and Netflix and occasionally in the cinema as  
            well with my friends. I think my second hobbie also links to my first hobbie as I get inspiration from the shows I watch and
            I add them into my novel. Like I also kind of add in characters from what I saw in the show or movie into my novel as well (although
            I try not to plagarise the character from the movie/show into my novel). This may be a little bit of a weird thing but I love it when
            shows or movies include foreign characters in their show. I think the inclusion of foreign characters in the show really spice things up
            for me instead of seeing just local characters in the show. Like for example, I watched this Korean movie called The Roundup: No Way Out 
            where it features the Japanese Yakuza being involved in the show even though the main protagonist and main antagonist were both
            Korean. My fascination for foreign characters in a show tend to also put inspiration in my novels as well! Lastly, I feel that some movies
            speak to me and they actually talk about things that we can actually relate to based on what we have experienced in life and I think that is           
            gets be pumped up as well.

        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #3 - Hanging out with friends 😀😀😀:</u></b></p>
        <p> My third hobbie/past time is actually just hanging out with friends and just being social in general. I think it is good to
            have friends (not the toxic ones!). Because your friends are there for you when you need support or when you need constructive
            feedback on yourself. I would also say friends are there for you to have fun but I would also like to say that most importantly,
            they are there for you when shit happens to you and you need help. I think what touched me about friendship was when an adult friend
            of mine talked to me about friendship. He told me that friendship is about being genuinely friends with the person and not because he
            or she has something you want like for e.g, you actually like him/her romantically and just want him/her to receprocate your feelings
            back. He also said that friends provide emotional support and constructive feedback for you and when bad things happen to you, your friends
            are there for you. He even said that in a relationship, your spouse/gf/bf is also your bestfriend as you both do things together and have
            deep conversations with each other as well. By the way, my adult friend has been married for about a year now. So yeah, what he said about 
            friendship really touched me and that is why my third hobbie/past time is hanging out with my friends :) 😀😀😀

        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #4 - Gaming🎮🎲:</u></b></p>
        <p> My fourth hobbie/past time is Gaming🎮🎲. I lean more towards indie games and my own past time games compared to like maybe those popular games like
            League of Legends, Valorant, DOTA etc. I like to play games from the past because these past time games I play grew up with me. Like Plants vs Zombies,
            Flash Games, Miniclip, Y8 etc. I do play some steam games but I like to play them with my friends which relates to the third hobby above because it is fun 
            playing games with friends. I don't really know why I like Indie games but I think I like it because indie games are created independently and the creator
            does not work with a company at all. He/She has a lot of good ideas for the game without being forced by the company to create a game that they like. They
            are their own bosses and the ideas that they think of are very creative but also very orthodox when it comes to self-developing a horror game (I swear self-developing
            horror games take it the next level compared to horror games developed by companies like Frictional Games, Monolith Productions etc.). On top of that, I also
            like to play pixelated games as well!👾

        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #5 - Using note-taking/organization apps in genral📆📝🗒️📔📓📒:</u></b></p>
        <p> My fifth hobbie/past time is using note-taking/organization apps in general. Weirdly enough this is like kind of one of my hobbies.
            And I do not know why it's included in "My Top 6 Most Favourite Hobby/Past Time" list/column at all 🤷‍♂️. Maybe it's because I like being
            organized in my stuff and being disorganized just really throws me off? I don't know 🤷‍♂️. But either ways, I just find joy in myself when
            I temper with the note-taking/organization apps, the apps help me plan my day/week/month/year much better compared to just writing it on 
            paper or a physical notebook. Maybe I just like using electronics more than physical pen and paper stuff 🤷‍♂️.

        <p><b><u>Hobbie/Past Time #6 - Walking🚶:</u></b></p>
        <p> My last hobbie/past time is walking. I love walking as a form of exercise. I love going out of campus to visit places like Maroubra, Eastgardens, Coogee, Eastlakes etc. I
            definitely do not like walking around Campus and that's another matter compared to the one above. As an international student, I love exploring different parts 
            of Sydney and my mode of transport to do so is simply by legs (although it will be by public transport if the place is too far from campus!). I like it as a form of
            exercise and I find myself being more relaxed and reflecting on myself or other stuff when I am walking to other closer suburbs from campus. It helps me to distress and I get to breathe in
            the fresh air when I do the above. It's also my past time back in Singapore. I would actually walk around the town/suburb I live in and also to closer towns/suburbs simply
            because I wanted to. I do walking with my mother and two younger twin brothers back in Singapore around the suburbs/towns as a form of exercise as a 
            family and so, I consider this as both my hobby and past time and it is placed in #6 position on "My Top 6 Most Favourite Hobby/Past Time" list!

                    <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
                    <p>As an IT subcommitee in ASEANSoc back in 2022, I was tasked to actually code this part of the UNSW Asean Conference 2020 website - 2nd half of
                        'Our Partners' page 2020/'Internal Partners' section 2020. The other IT subcomms were tasked to code other parts of the UAC 2020 website, the task
                        was split amongst us. We had to code the website because the society decided to archive the UAC 2020 website which means it will no longer be there 
                        anymore and so we had to code the website so that we still have records of the UAC 2020 website even though it is now gone.
                        This was actually kind of the first time I really used HTML and CSS (mostly) to code a part of a website. It was a bit nerve wrecking at first but I 
                        soon got the hang of it and managed to code out this awesome masterpiece you see above! 🖼️🎨🖌️This is actually one of my first projects I've ever done!
                        And I cannot believe I managed to do it! 😀😆👍
